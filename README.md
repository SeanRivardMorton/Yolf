# Yolf
This is a writing application intended for people who want to just write, aimlessly

## Description
Yolf is for people that journal, or write for fun. Really, just a big dumb brain dump. All over the paper.

I want it to be very minimalistic, not for the purpose of looking good- I want it to be minimalistic so that the user can focus on the writing.
I want an extremely simple interface, with a text box and a save button. 
If for whatever reason the user wants to see their old writing, they can click a button to see a list of their old entries.
I want different layouts, and themes, and fonts. I want the user to be able to customize their writing experience, but I still want it to be simple.
I want it to connect to your Spotify or audo, so that background colours can get synchronized with the music.

(Center this for a fun vim workout)
