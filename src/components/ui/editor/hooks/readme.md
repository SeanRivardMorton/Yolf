# State is not working correctly. I don't know if the issue lies in the fetch into the provider or the state itself.

I am considering switching to Zustand. It might be a easier way to work with state via hooks.
I don't want to have to think about a complicated rendering strategy from a front-end framework.

And I feel like every app I've tried to roll it out all nice and sexy, this always happens.
Maybe I just have a poor understanding of how to manage state in react. I don't know.

Anyway. I think I'm going to switch to Zustand.
